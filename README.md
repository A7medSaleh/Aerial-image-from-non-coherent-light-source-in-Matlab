This code calculates the aerial image in photolithography printed on waver from a mask using a non-coherent light source.

Optical Lithography is a process of printing. A pattern to be printed on the substrate is carved on the mask, when light passes through the pattern and fall onto the photoresist the mask pattern is printed on the photoresist, the exposed part then becomes chemically solvable and can be removed by wet etching. Eventually, another substrate etchant eats away the exposed part of the substrate, leaving behind the desired circuit drawn onto the substrate.

The main problem with Optical Lithography is when the used lightâ€™s wavelength becomes comparable to the dimensions of the features to be printed on the wafer. To illustrate, diffraction and interference of light become pronounced resulting in blurring and even distortion of the patterns projected on the wafer .
This code takes in the mask pattern as image file and then simulates the photolithography process and calculates the normalized light intensity at the wafer level also it calculates the arial image and compare it with the mask image to calculate the error.
You can control the technology and simulation parameters as explained in the video.
